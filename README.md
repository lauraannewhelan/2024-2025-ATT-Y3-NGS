# ðŸ§¬ Lab: Next generation sequencing analysis 1&2 ðŸ§¬

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the essential steps involved in processing high-quality reads from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and mapping them to a reference genome. You will learn how to perform quality control on short-read NGS data, carry out the mapping of high-quality reads, and understand the post-mapping processes necessary for effective variant calling and annotation. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the entire workflow, including data preparation, quality control, read mapping, and the generation of variant databases. 

## Learning outcomes
### NGS analysis 1
- Review the structure and origin of sequencing reads.
- Outline the file formats in which reads and mapped reads are stored in.
- Describe the basic quality control steps that are necessary for processing of read data.
- Describe the process of read mapping.
  
### NGS analysis 2
- Understand the motivation to identify variants from NGS data in a clinical setting.
- Describe the GATK best practises for variant identification.
- Describe the file format that variants are stored in.
- Outline the primary measures of variant quality control.

Note: I have "pre-made" all the files for you. You're going to perform all the steps to make these files too, but computationally some of these steps take a long time. Because of this, we have pre-made files waiting for you. Think of it like a cooking show - here's one we made earlier!
